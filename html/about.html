                Although I do not yet possess a degree, I do have a certificate for completing a course on HTML 5 and CSS 3. Also, I am currently pursuing a bachelor's in computer science. Through my school coursework, I have also learned the basics of Python and Java. I am a fast learner and enjoy anything that challenges me to do better and be better. Additionally, being a wife, student and mother of seven children I can confidently say I am a pro at handling conflict, constructive criticism and juggling multiple assignments at once, all while not missing deadlines. I have learned to follow schedules to complete my schoolwork on time, while simultaneously helping my children with school projects and completing errands for the household. And where I know I can't handle the burden on my own, I ask for help. Many people don't ask for help because they may feel inadequate, but I know there is no shame in asking for assistance.

                Why did I get into coding? The simple answer is I love the creativity of bringing other's ideas to life. Some enter the proverbial "zone" during yoga, exercise, or while having a cup of coffee or tea. For me, it's the process of taking an idea and coding that into a well designed website. That is what puts me in the zone. They say if you do what you love it will never feel like work, and building websites and applications never feels like work. It is a passion that burns like a million candles deep inside my core.

                Moreover, a website is a glimpse into the life of an individual or a business. Details about their beliefs, ideas, passion and mission can be found with a few clicks of a button. I strive to present that information in a beautiful, yet informative, way. We don't get a second chance at a first impressions and a website usually is one's first impression to so many who come looking to learn more about them. It must be phenomenal if they are to return and my mission is to create the phenomenal.
