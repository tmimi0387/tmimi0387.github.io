            <p>My First Website Build. As can be seen from the tables, this displays my most basic HTML and CSS skills. This build is included, however, because of the research that went into creating it. Before creating the site, I had to learn the folklore of La Llorona.</p>

            <p>This features <b>Responsive Website Design</b>. It is a little over the top in terms of color scheme, but that was my assignment. My instructions were to change the background color, size and placement of photos and the size of the paragraphs depending on the screen size.</p>

            <p>A website built from a wireframe where the user can order food and have it delivered to their house. On the request page <b>JavaScript</b> is utilized to automatically calculate the total price. </p>

            <p>Currently, this is my pièce de résistance. It is still a work in progress, so it's not completely done yet. However, getting the similar photos, placement and color scheme has been challenging. That is why I regard this piece so highly. The time that went into this will make the finished site that much more special to me.</p>
